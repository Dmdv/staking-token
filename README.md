# Smart contracts for Staking

[![built-with openzeppelin](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-OpenZeppelin-3677FF)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/)

**Staking** provides a Scalable Reward Distribution option to all stakers. Users can deposit CenX tokens deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and receive a reward depending on the user share in total staking amount while tokens are locked in the contract.

Staking gives users an additional choice for CenX token usage. There are no minimum deposit requirements and several withdrawal options available for users. Reward will be accrued depending on the user deposit percentage.

Staking serves to reduce the overall amount of CenX in active circulation, provides options for CenX holders on Ethereum, and acts as a mechanism to limit available liquidity and supply.
